<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Programming is a science as well as an art. Developing the required skills takes time and effort and an enthusiasm to learn. The learning draws parallels with that of learning a natural language such as English.
Just as the required skills to learn a natural language are reading, listening, writing and speaking, so the skills for learning a programming language are reading code, writing code. Also just as we need to know the proper language constructs like grammar (syntax), contextual use of language (semantics), we need to learn the syntax as well as</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Like learning natural language involves listening as a major component, programming language skills are developed by reading lots of good code. It exposes the learner to good programming practices.</p>

<p>Some famous libraries that help in learning how APIs are written. By reading their source code, one can learn how good programmers structure their code and also how to abstract functionality so that code has increased reusability quotient.</p>

<h2 id="hands-on-tutorials">Hands on Tutorials</h2>
<p>Following are hands on tutorials for various aspects of program development. As a typical cycle of program development involves</p>

<ul>
  <li>writing source code</li>
  <li>compiling the code</li>
  <li>debugging the code</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing-cc-program-todo">Writing C/C++ program (#TODO)</h3>

<p>Tutorials explaining good programming practices while writing code are given here. Some esoteric aspects of writing good code, which I cannot at the current moment categorize them due to my own lack of understanding, are</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoiding hard coding</li>
  <li>practing a convention for writing code. Though there is no C++ standard for writing the code, in order for the code to be readable, we need to adopt one convention and stick. There is no universal convention. Some adopt the Hungarian convention for the brackets, what is the other one I dont have idea. A <a href="https://lazyfoo.net/articles/article02/index.php">LazyFoo article on writing readable code</a> and an <a href="https://inkscape.org/develop/coding-style/">article on coding style for Inkscape project</a> are starters.
    <ul>
      <li>properly indent code</li>
      <li>give descriptive names to the variables</li>
      <li>Develop a naming standard</li>
      <li>Properly comment your code</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>refactoring (not sure what that means… however most of the Inkscape legacy code is undergoing refactoring)</li>
  <li>any good references for writing code?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compiling-a-cc-program">Compiling a C/C++ program</h3>
<p>Compiling can be as simple as executing the command</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>g++ helloWorld.cpp -o helloWorld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or as difficult as compiling  various source files, linking various static and dynamic libraries. It is one of the important component of program development. These tutorials provide hands on experience with compiling C++ programs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn the basics of compilation from a <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/learn-how-to-compile-a-c-program-382c4c690bdc">Medium post titled Learn How to Compile a C++ program</a></li>
  <li>Individual steps of compilation of a C program are beautifully explained
in a <a href="https://www.cs-fundamentals.com/c-programming/how-to-compile-c-program-using-gcc">CS fundamentals blog post</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="static-vs-dynamic-linking">Static vs Dynamic Linking</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A simple explanation of static and dynamic libraries in a <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/">Learncpp tutorial</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further discussion is done in a <a href="https://cs-fundamentals.com/tech-interview/c/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-linking">CS fundamentals post</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Optional) A nuanced comparison of performance issues with static and dynamic linking in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1993390/static-linking-vs-dynamic-linking">SO post</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-use-library-for-application-development">How to use library for Application development</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We need to configure the compiler of our IDE and a [LearnCPP post] explains it using the case of VisualStudio and Codeblocks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a simple concrete example a <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/navigating-the-world-of-distributed-c-code-e439406f3e42">Medium post titled Navigating the world of distributed code</a> explains how to work with uncompiled library/ header only libary and use <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> tool to configure the compiler</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a concrete example, I was successful in configuring the MingW compiler of Codeblocks IDE to use <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/index.php">SDL2 library</a> by following the [GRHMedia blog post] listed in the <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/Tutorials">SDL’s Tutorial Wiki</a> as a video tutorial.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="advancedhow-to-create-a-library">(Advanced)How to create a library?</h3>

<p>This is an advanced topic. I have not explored it but can refer to <a href="https://www.cs-fundamentals.com/c-programming/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-c#static-libraries">Create Static and Dynamic Link Libraries in C on Linux</a> from CS-fundamentals blog.</p>
