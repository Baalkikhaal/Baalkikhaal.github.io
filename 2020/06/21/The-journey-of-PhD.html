<p>A preliminary search on <a href="https://github.com/topics">GitHub Topics</a> listed more than a 100 repositories having <code class="highlighter-rouge">phd-thesis</code> tag. The ones that I found interesting are</p>

<ul>
  <li>List of resources on <a href="https://github.com/macoj/phd">how/why to do a PhD</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/katrinleinweber/PhD-thesis">PhD thesis workflow with Git + Scientific Markdown</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Interaction with Vishwanath. he suggested Nature News feature article on <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/what-s-the-point-of-the-phd-thesis-1.20203">What is the point of the PhD thesis?</a>. This is not about PhD per se, but about the PhD thesis.</p>

<p>Interaction with Mihir. He suggested few articles how <strong>NOT</strong> to procrastinate and start writing the thesis.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jameshaytonphd.com/quick-tips/how-i-wrote-a-phd-thesis-in-3-months">How I wrote a PhD thesis in 3 months</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/04/how-write-your-phd-thesis">How to write your Ph.D. thesis</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://cheekyscientist.com/insiders-guide-to-write-a-thesis-when-short-on-time/">How to write thesis when short on time</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Interaction with Banibrato. He suggested <a href="https://mathpix.com/">Mathpix tool</a> for quickly extracting latex source from snapshots of LaTex typeset equations</p>

<p>Interaction with Ajesh. He suggested <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/">Connected Papers</a>, a unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work.</p>

<p>Interaction with Venkatreddy. He suggested <a href="https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi">Gummi</a>, a LaTeX editor that generates compiled LaTeX code on the fly!</p>

<h1 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://paperscape.org/">Paperscape</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Paperscape is an interactive map that visualises the arXiv, an open, online repository for scientific research papers.</p>

<p>Each paper is represented by a circle, with the size of a circle related to how often that paper has been cited (referred to) - a measure of its impact.</p>

<p>The papers are clustered together according to how they reference each other i.e. share information. This is done by modeling the papers as particles in a physical system, with references acting as attractive forces between papers - read more.</p>
