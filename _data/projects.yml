- name: KerrPy
  description: An openCV based Python project for processing Kerr microscopy image. KerrPy is used to extract ellipse fits of bubble domains created under the application of out-of-plane and in-plane fields. These fits are used to estimate the underlying Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI).
