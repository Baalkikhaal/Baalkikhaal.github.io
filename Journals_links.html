The objective of science is to generate knowledge. Knowledge has to be disseminated / spread for the benefit of the community. For this we use journals. Journals are classified on two parameters. One is the field of interest. You can have a journal for superconductivity where all the researchers of the superconductivity community share their new findings. This acts as convenient handle for gathering/surveying, storing/archiving information, instead of looking for everywhere. The other parameter is the quality / impact of the work. You are a researcher in superconductivity and you think you have found some thing pathbreaking. You would like the whole world to know about it. The best way is to publish in the most sought after journal

Surface Science Reports contains invited review papers on experimental and theoretical studies in the physics, chemistry and pioneering applications of surfaces, interfaces and nanostructures. It covers topics which contribute to a better understanding of basic phenomena occurring on surfaces and interfaces, but also the application of this knowledge to the development of materials, processes and devices. "Surfaces" is defined in this journal to include all interfaces between solids, liquids, polymers, biomaterials, nanostructures, soft matter, gases and/or vacuum. The journal also contains reviews of experimental techniques and methods used to characterize surfaces and surface processes, e.g. those based upon the interactions of photons, electrons and ions with surfaces.
