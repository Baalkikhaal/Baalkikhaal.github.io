# Historical context

We encounter Onsager's reciprocity relations in Phase transitions(Eugene Stanley) as well as theory of micromagnetics (W.F. Brown)

From Brataas Nature Review[2012]

>This follows from Onsagerâ€™s reciprocity relations showing that spin pumping and spin-transfer torque are two fundamentally equivalent dynamic processes in magnetic structures



# Some examples

- Spin transfer torque vs spin pumping

- spin Hall effect vs inverse spin Hall effect

- Piezo electric effect vs ???

- Magnetoelastic anistropy vs inverse magneto striction

- Spin Nernst effect
