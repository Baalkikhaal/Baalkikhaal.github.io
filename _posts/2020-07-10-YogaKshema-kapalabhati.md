# asanas

- After initial stretching exercises, get to standing posture.
    - TAdAsana (ताडासन) : Standing posture
    - Side stretching : Extend the arms along shoulder line **keeping in mind not** to stretch the shoulder girdle. Rotate from the waist by 90 degrees clockwise and counter clockwise
    - Side bending: Keep the arms touching the trunk and drag the palms downwards. Repeat other side.
    - Backward bending: Place the palms on waist with thumbs on the backbone. Mindful of the navel and chest center, extend them outwards while bending backward **during the exhaling**

# prAnAyama

- kapAlabhAti is a variant of abdominal diaphragmic breathing where there is conscious contraction of the abdominal muscles during exhalation followed by restoring relaxation of the muscles leading to "automatic" inhalation.
- As a **subtle breathing technique**, which needs mastery, it is **important** to not overdo the contraction as well as frequency of breathing should be manageable without much exertion and the number of repititions not exceeding 20 in the initial stages
