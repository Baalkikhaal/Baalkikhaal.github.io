# Swami Vivekananda

In the draft of National Education Policy 2019,

>According to Swami Vivekananda,
“Education is not the amount of information that we put into your brain and
runs riot there, undigested, all your life. We must have life-building, man-making, character-making assimilation of ideas. If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character, you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library. If education is identical with information, the libraries are the greatest sages of the world and encyclopedia are the greatest Rishis”.
