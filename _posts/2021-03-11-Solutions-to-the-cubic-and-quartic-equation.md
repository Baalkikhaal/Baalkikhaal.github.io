excerpt: "The domain wall energy for Neel walls in the presence of in-plane bias satisfy a cubic or quartic depending on the presence or absence of tilted anisotropy. In this post, we will look at finding the analytical and numeric solutions to these algebraic equations using Python package numpy."
