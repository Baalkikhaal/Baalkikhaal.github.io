# Story

If you feel lockdown is unbearable, take inspiration from the great personality Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 21 years with 19 years of gruelling solitary confinement during apartheid regime of South Africa. Within this period, he suffered loss of his mother and his son. Yet persevered this struggle and later became the first president of democratic South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
