excerpt: "Scientific temperament is not a state. It is a continuous process for aligning one's behaviour to the inculcate the spirit of the scientific method. There are many aspects to this process each addressing one or more of the pillars of the scientific method. Here are some guidelines that help nurture these aspects."

The scientific method consists of four pillars

- Observation
- Experiment
- Theory
- Dissemination

While the first three pillars are confined to the researcher, 
dissemination enable interaction between them. 
Dissemination has duly gained prominence in modern science. 

The ability to communicate the research is paramount in a fast-paced, attention-deprived world.

The current standard of dissemination is through research papers. Consequently, 
it is imperative to inculcate rigour in our writing. 
Further, academic talks also complement the former mode of dissemination. The following references
act as guidelines for writing research papers and giving academic talks.
