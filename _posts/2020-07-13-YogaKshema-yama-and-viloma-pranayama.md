# Practice

- With the standard lying back with legs close to the bottom posture, loosen the major muscles of gluteus and thighs; and minor muscles of calf and foot; and warm the knees.
- Rotate the trunk with left hand against the knee and right hand behind the back on fingers. Repeat on the symmetric counterpart.
- Standing up without taking support of the hands. There are five ways with ordering of graded difficulty
    - put the hands forward and lift
    - lift the hands and lift
    - forward fold the hands and lift
    - backward fold the hands with palms near bottom and lift
    - backward fold the hands with palms at chest line and lift
- These five standing practices are interleaved with the five principles of yama outlined below in theory.

# Pranayama

- A new way of breathing called Viloma. Viloma is a variant of abdominal diaphragmic breathing where inhalation is in 3 stages
    - first stage activates the lower abdominal muscles near the pelvis
    - second stage activates the middle muscles
    - third stage activates the upper muscles
- The exhalation reverses the process with
    - first stage contracting the upper muscles
    - second stage contracting the middle muscles
    - third stage contracting the lower muscles

# Theory

- Yoga is not about simply doing asanas and breathing. Its a holistic approach for betterment of personality and simultaneously the society. For this, sage Patanjali gave the Ashtanga Yoga Sutras. The first tenet of this sutras is the concept of Yama. Yama means "Donts". There are five donts
    - Ahimsa (अहिंसा) : Non-violence of type physical, mental
    - Satya (सत्य) : Truth
    - Asteya (अस्तेय) : Non stealing of type physical, intellectual
    - Brahmacharya (ब्रह्मचर्य) : Avoiding excess indulgence in sensual pleasures
    - Aparigraha (अपरिग्रह) : Avoid greed; Minimizing acquiring essential things and avoiding acquiring non-essential things.
