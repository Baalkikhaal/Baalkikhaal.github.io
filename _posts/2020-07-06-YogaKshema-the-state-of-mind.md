# Practice
- Basic stretching exercises
- Abdominal breathing by putting left hand on the abdomen and right hand on the chest. Ensure while inhaling or exhaling, only the abdomen moves while the chest is stationary.
- Close the eyes and focus on a relatively large and stationary object like a building, temple. Try to focus on the object for 2 min

# Theory
There are four states of mind

- क्षिप्त अवस्था unable to focus at all
- विक्षिप्त अवस्था state of mind oscillates between focus and defocus
- मूढ़ अवस्था  A drowsy state of mind
- एकाग्रतः अवस्था desired state of mind where mind can focus
