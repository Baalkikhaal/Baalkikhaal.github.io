A preliminary search on [GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics) listed more than a 100 repositories having `phd-thesis` tag. The ones that I found interesting are

- List of resources on [how/why to do a PhD](https://github.com/macoj/phd)
- [PhD thesis workflow with Git + Scientific Markdown](https://github.com/katrinleinweber/PhD-thesis)

Interaction with Vishwanath. he suggested Nature News feature article on [What is the point of the PhD thesis?](https://www.nature.com/news/what-s-the-point-of-the-phd-thesis-1.20203). This is not about PhD per se, but about the PhD thesis.

Interaction with Mihir. He suggested few articles how **NOT** to procrastinate and start writing the thesis.

- [How I wrote a PhD thesis in 3 months](https://jameshaytonphd.com/quick-tips/how-i-wrote-a-phd-thesis-in-3-months)
- [How to write your Ph.D. thesis](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/04/how-write-your-phd-thesis)
- [How to write thesis when short on time](https://cheekyscientist.com/insiders-guide-to-write-a-thesis-when-short-on-time/)

Interaction with Banibrato. He suggested [Mathpix tool](https://mathpix.com/) for quickly extracting latex source from snapshots of LaTex typeset equations

Interaction with Ajesh. He suggested [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), a unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work.

Interaction with Venkatreddy. He suggested [Gummi](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi), a LaTeX editor that generates compiled LaTeX code on the fly!

# Miscellaneous

- [Paperscape](https://paperscape.org/)

Paperscape is an interactive map that visualises the arXiv, an open, online repository for scientific research papers.

Each paper is represented by a circle, with the size of a circle related to how often that paper has been cited (referred to) - a measure of its impact.

The papers are clustered together according to how they reference each other i.e. share information. This is done by modeling the papers as particles in a physical system, with references acting as attractive forces between papers - read more.
