# Condensed Matter Physics I



-  "Solid State Physics" by N. W. Ashcroft and N. D. Mermin

From [Prof. Mona Berciu UBC Canada](https://phas.ubc.ca/~berciu/TEACHING/PHYS502/)

> ** I have not chosen it as the required textbook because it does not use second quantization notation.** This notation became our "language" only after the book was written, and you need to become fluent in it if you want to be able to read modern condensed matter literature.

- "A quantum approach to condensed matter physics" by P.L. Taylor and O. Heinonen
- "Condensed matter in a nutshell" by G. D. Mahan
- "Introduction to solid-state theory" by O. Madelung
- "Quantum theory of solids" by C. Kittel
# Second quantization

- Orland and Negele
- Fetter and Walecka
