## What is Python?

- Python is a versatile programming language that facilitates variety of programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.
- It is a high level programming language that has gained acceptance amongst a wide spectrum of users ranging from scientists to data analysts, economists to stock-market players.
- As it is an interpreted instead of compiled langu, it offers rapid implementation and testing of ideas.

## Scientific computing with Python

- Python has been well adopted by the scientific community.
- While the core of the language is minimalistic, various packages have been built on top of the core, that extend the functionality of the language.
- The packages heavily used by the scientific community are numpy, scipy, matplotlib, mayavi.


## References

Due to the popularity of the language, numerous references have proliferated that teach the language.

[Python's standard documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is the canonical reference for the core features of the language.

Similarly,

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/),
- [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/),
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
- [mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/)

provide documentation for the frequently scientific computing packages.

### Auxiliary references

Following are the auxiliary references that complement that standard documentation.
