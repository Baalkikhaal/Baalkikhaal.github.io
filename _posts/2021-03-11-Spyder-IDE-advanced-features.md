# Advanced features

From [Spyder GitHub][1]

> - Harness the power of as many IPython consoles as you like with full workspace and debugging support, all within the flexibility of a full GUI interface. Instantly run your code by line, cell, or file, and render plots right inline with the output or in interactive windows.

> - Examine your code with the static analyzer, trace its execution with the interactive debugger, and unleash its performance with the profiler. Keep things organized with project support and a built-in file explorer, and use find in files to search across entire projects with full regex support.
