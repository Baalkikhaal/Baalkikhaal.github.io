    <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>People call me Sreekar. My mother calls me Sree. I am a graduate student of Physics at the Indian Institute of Science. An experimentalist by training, I derive happiness when I explore the simulation aspects of my work.</p>

<p>My work broadly revolves around the field of <a href="/2020/05/24/spintronics.html">spintronics</a>. I specialize in the domain wall based magnetic memories where I use currents to drive domain walls which act as memory elements.</p>

<p>In this homepage, I share my interests in the form of posts categorized broadly into physics and programming. The physics posts pertain mostly but not limited to magnetism whereas the programming posts focus mostly on Python programming language.</p>

<p>Also sometimes I share my varied explorations in other fields such as vector graphics, games.</p>

<p>Also for piece of mind, I wander the woods and mountains. I like the architectures if they are not crowded. My discoveries are in and around the peninsular India. I have some nature posts too.</p>
