    <h1 id="about-the-page">About the page</h1>

<p>In this homepage, fubar and company share their interests in the form of posts categorized broadly into physics and programming. The physics posts pertain mostly but not limited to magnetism whereas the programming posts focus mostly on Python programming language.</p>

<p>Also sometimes fubar shares his varied explorations in other fields such as vector graphics, games.</p>

<p>Also for piece/peace(?) of mind, fubar likes to wander the woods and mountains. Fubar likes man made architectures if they are not crowded. His discoveries are in and around the peninsular India. He has some nature posts too.</p>
